# DLCM
Here we provides codes for the process-oriented soil carbon model—Double Layer Carbon Model.
## Model Introduction
The Double Layer Carbon Model (DLCM) is an advanced and comprehensive tool designed to simulate soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics for both the top 20 cm layer (SOC20) and the deeper 20-100 cm layer (SOC20–100). The fundamental principle of the DLCM revolves around accurately predicting SOC dynamics by simulating the interactions between fresh organic matter inputs, microbial activity, and existing soil carbon pools. The DLCM defines four soil carbon pools, categorized based on their location within the soil profile and their decomposition rates. The model divides the soil profile into topsoil (0-20 cm) and subsoil (20–100 cm) layers to match the SOC maps of the corresponding two layers generated by data-driven models. Each of these layers contains a young carbon pool (CY) with a higher decomposition rate and an old carbon pool (CO) with a lower decomposition rate. Specifically, the topsoil contains the young topsoil carbon pool (CYt) and the old topsoil carbon pool (COt), while the subsoil contains the young subsoil carbon pool (CYs) and the old subsoil carbon pool (COs). These compartments help accurately simulate the dynamics of SOC by considering both the fast-cycling and slow-cycling components of organic matter decomposition. The DLCM optimizes initial SOC stocks using extensive spatial simulations, ensuring accurate baseline carbon levels. It also incorporates climate change responses, adjust decomposition rates based on climate and environmental changes, and lead to robust estimates under different climatic scenarios. The simulation process of the DLCM involves initializing SOC stocks with spatially detailed baseline data, adding organic matter inputs based on vegetation production, and simulating microbial decomposition while adjusting for climate variables such as temperature and soil moisture. The model performs layer-specific calculations to capture depth-specific SOC dynamics. It relies on comprehensive input data, including initial SOC stocks, climate data, and vegetation production to drive these simulations.
## Model Inputs
Data used to drive the DLCM include annual net primary production (NPP) from 1982 to 2018, SOC maps in the two soil layers during the 1980s, annual mean temperature maps from 1982 to 2018, and annual surface soil moisture and root-zone soil moisture maps from 1982 to 2018.
